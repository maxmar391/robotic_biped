# Humanoid robot (robotic biped)

This repository contains the Arduino code files for an humanoid robot (robotic biped) based on the system published by on https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Controlled-Robotic-Biped/ by the user Technovation. 

I have adapted the system to work with an Arduino Nano instead of the original Arduino Uno and use a commercial board for the connection of the motors instead of the original custom-made board.

## Bill of materials
* Arduino Nano
* PCA9685 servo motor driver board (for instance https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07V5GVYGM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* 6x MG995 servo motors
* 6x ball bearings (more information on the original instructables.com website)
* M4 nuts and bolts
* 3D printed parts (more information on the original instructables.com website)
* Power supply
